laugh
goes
round
the

This

Chandra
and
some
his

students
are
going

Both

alert
expressions.
What's
going
on?
Are
they

pierces
the

and

Janice,

over

gratified.
"Let's

says
Mum.
"And
you
can

about

This
the
moment
I've

And

I'm

Jessica.
All
life,
without
knowing
it,
I've
had
sister,
growing
miles
away,
with
idea
existed
either.
And
today,
last,
I'm
going
meet
her!
Just
the
thought
makes
feel
exhilarated
and
jumpy
all
once.
How
will
the
same?
How
will
different?
What
will
her
voice
like?
What
will
her
clothes
like?
"Do
look
OK?"

Luke,
while
anxiously
surveying

and
I'm
putting

It's
taken
several
days,
but
after

I've

"You

Luke

patiently.
"It's

"So

And
the

Actually,
I'm
not
sure
what
the
T-shirt
says,
apart
from
"I'm

I'm

I'm
bit
wound-up,
but
just
can't
get
over
the
idea
having
sister
after
being
only
child
for
long.
Not
that
I've
minded
being
own
anything.
Mum
and
Dad
and
have
always
had
great
time
together.
But
sometimes
I've
heard
other
people
talking
about
their
brothers
and
sisters
and
wondered
what
was
like.

actually

out!
What's
really
spooky
that
all
this
week,
I've
suddenly
been
noticing
sisters.
They're
everywhere!
For
example,
the
film
Little
Women
was
telly
the
other
afternoon-and
right
after
was
program
about
the
Beverley
Sisters!
And
every
time
I've
seen
two
women
together
the
street,
instead
just
noticing
what
they
were
wearing,
I've
thought,
"Are
they
sisters?"
It's
like
there's
whole
world
sisters
out
there
and
finally
I'm
part
it.
feel
smarting
eyes
and
blink
hard.
It's
ridiculous,
but
ever
since
heard
about
Jessica,
emotions
have
been
all
over
the
place.
Last
night
was
reading
this
brilliant
book
called
Long-Lost
Sisters:
The
Love
They
Never
Knew
They
Had
and
tears
were
streaming
down
cheeks!
The
stories
were
just
amazing.
One
was
about
these
three
Russian
sisters
who
were
the
same
concentration
camp
during
the
war
but
didn't
know
it.
Then
there
was
this
woman
who
was
told
her
sister
had
been
killed
but
she
would
never
believe
it,
and
then
she
got
cancer
and
there
was
one
look
after
her
three
children,
but
they
found
the
sister
alive,
just
time
for
them

God,
I'm
going

just
thinking
about
it.
take
deep
breath
and
wander
over
the
table
where
I've
put
present
for
Jessica.

Luke,

was

reluctantly.

The
plan
is,
Jessica's
going

when
her
train
gets
Oxshott
Station,
then
Dad
will
and
pick
her
up.
It's
pure
coincidence
that
she's
going
London
this
week.
She
lives
Cumbria,

apparently
she

Why
does
Luke

now?
This

day!

sheepishly.
"Thanks.
So,
are
they

"Almost."
"Oh,

too
badly

"No,
didn't,"

Luke.

"There

THIS
HAS
BEEN
the
worst
week

entire
marriage.
I've
barely
seen
Luke,
he's
been
tied
with
work.
He's
had
meetings
every
day
with

It's

been
total

And

instead
having
chance
relax
and
regroup,
he's
got

Nathan

want
do,
but
has
to-because

out
with
some
excuse,
Nathan

might
get
offended.
According
all
the

it's
looking
likely
that
Nathan

This
how
he's
been
all

All
quiet
and
scary
and
barely

And

Honestly.
I'm
not

It's

How

Like,

How
cool
that?
Jess
gave
that
tip.
She

much.
I've
been
staying
with
her
ever
since
got
out
the
hospital,
and
she's
been
just
brilliant.
She
gave
her
bedroom
because
there
are
fewer
stairs
than
the
guest
room,
and
she
helps
get
and
out
the
bath
with
plaster
cast,
and
she
makes
vegetable
soup
every
day
for
lunch.
She's
even
going
teach
how

it,
because

something
else,
which
can't
it's

and
only

And
then,
with
the
extra
money
you
save,
you
can
buy
something
really
nice
like
one
Elizabeth's
homemade
fruit
pies!
(That
was
the
tip
gave
Jess.
You

we're

that

It's

Suze
here,
just
like
old
times.
She
and
Tarquin
have
been
staying
Edie's

for
the
last
few
days
and
Tarquin
has
pretty

taken
charge
the
babies,
except
when
Suze
needs
feed
them
the
mornings
and
evenings.
And
it's
been
great.
We've
spent
loads
time
together,
chilling,
and
eating,
and
talking
about
everything
under
the
sun.
Sometimes
just
and
Suze-and
sometimes
with
Jess
too.
Like
last
night,
the
three
made
margaritas
and
watched
which

Jess
enjoyed.
Even
though
she
didn't

like
did.
Then
one
night,
when
Suze
went

some
relation
hers
who
lives
twenty
miles
away,
Jess
and
spent
the
evening
together.
She
showed
all
her

and
told
all
about
them-and

told
her
about

and

from

it's

For

I'm

I've

And
I'm
